#0.0.2 - A little update

- Updated from Play 2.3.x to 2.4.x (Which meant some refactoring of the code)
- Restructured the db model
- Added the play-silhouette plugin, for authendicating against the trello api (custom provider)

##Breaking changes

Since the db model changed, the two version aren't directly compatible.

#0.0.1 - Initial version (04-04-2015)

- Basic user management
- Basic sum of the card points

Made as a very simple tool for generating trello board burn up graph. 
Initially written in Java and later moved to Scala. Some work needs to be done to make the code more idiomatic Scala.
